Hello, I am Kartikey Tewari. I work as a Software Developer Engineer 1 at Amazon, Bengaluru. I completed my Computer Science and Engineering Dual Degree of B.Tech and M.Tech from National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur. I have previsously worked as SDE Intern at Source.one and FAH Technologies. I like to code, solve Rubik's cube and listen to music. This is a blog where I write about the projects and technologies that I am working on.

I do most of my competitive programming in C and C++. I am also quite familiar with Python, Linux system and AWS cloud. For web development I tend to use the MEN (Mongo-Express-Node) stack. I am also familiar with Jekyll themes and Ruby. I manage most of my projects using git and my go to solution for deployment is Heroku and Github-pages. I also have experience in Image Processing, Parallel Computing and System Encryption. My resume is <a href="/resume.pdf"> here </a>.
