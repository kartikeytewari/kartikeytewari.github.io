Hi, there! I am Kartikey Tewari, a Computer Science and engineering undergraduate student at National Institute of Technology (NIT), Hamirpur pursuing Dual Degree (BTech and MTech). Previous summer I did a remote internship as Software Developer Engineer (SDE) at FAH Technologies, Singapore. I am a competitive programmer and a web developer.  I like to code, solve Rubik's cube and listen to music. This is a blog where I write about the projects and technologies that I am working on.

I do most of my competitive programming in C and C++. I am also quite familiar with Python, Linux system and Bash shell. For web development I tend to use the MEN (Mongo-Express-Node) stack. I am also familiar with Jekyll themes and Ruby. I manage most of my projects using git and my go to solution for deployment is Heroku and Github-pages. I also have experience in Image Processing, Parallel Computing and System Encryption. My resume is <a href="/resume.pdf"> here </a>.
